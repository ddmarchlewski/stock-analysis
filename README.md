### Analysis

Before I did any refactoring, I copied the code used to make the chart headers, input box and ticker arrary. I also made sure that the right worksheet was activated. The instructions I followed, along with the code, is written in the VBS_Challenge file. 

The data here has two chart. Both contain information on the 12 individual stocks. The data shows ticker names, dates of when the stocks were issued, an opening price, highest and lowest price, closing price and adjusted price, and volumes of each stock.
