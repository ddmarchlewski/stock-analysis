# Stock Analysis using Microcoft Excel VBA

## Overview 
### Purpose
This projects purpose was to refactor code from Microsoft Excel VBA and gather stock information in years 2017 and 2018. The goal is to make the orignal code more effiecent. 

## Results
### Analysis
Before I did any refactoring, I copied the code used to make the chart headers, input box and ticker arrary. I also made sure that the right worksheet was activated. The instructions I followed, along with the code, is written in the VBS_Challenge file.  

The image below shows an analysis of all the stocks from the year 2017 using the new code. This code performed the analysis much faster than the orignal. The orignal code did this same analysis in approxiamtly 1 second, while the new one only took about a fourth of the time.

This next image shows an analysis of all the stocks from the year 2018 using the new code. Just like before, the new code was a lot faster than the orignal.

## Summary 
### Pros and Cons of Refactoring Code
Whats nice about refactoring is that it cleans up our code and makes and organizes it better. This ultimatlty leads to faster programming and software improvement. Refactoring also makes the code and project easier to understand to anyone else that sees it. 
There are some downsides to refactoring. Depending on the size of the application, refactoring can be very time comsuming. If you refactor wrong, you can potentailly create new bugs. 
As far as this projects concern, refactoring was beneficial by decreasing macro run times. As stated previously, the original analysis took roughly 1 second to complete. While the new macro took about 0.2 seconds to run.
